        <p><strong>NIKE FREE TR FIT</strong>
        Each Nike 2010 World Championship Football jersey is made entirely from recycled polyester. That's up to eight recycled plastic bottles per jersey. In total, that diverted nearly 13 million plastic bottles from landfills. Yes, you read right. 13 million. Plastic. Bottles.</p>

        <h1>One shoe does good,
            the other shoe kicks ass.</h1>   
        <p><strong>NIKE FREE TR FIT</strong>
        The Free TR Fit is designed with a lower environmental impact using
        environmentally preferred rubber, water-based cementing and recycled polyester.
        That means every step in the multi-directional flex groove outsole replicates
        the foot's natural movement and helps women get more out of their workout without
        leaving a huge environmental footprint. Everyone's a winner.</p>
